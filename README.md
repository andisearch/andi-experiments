# Andi Experiments

This contains some experiments and samples scripts for querying common APIs and generating sample utterances for use by NLP models or bot engines like Microsoft Bot Framework, AWS Lex or DialogFlow.

Some are working and others are just starting points to play with.

A number of the APIs require an API key. We've used RapidAPI where it's an option to make things a little quicker to get started.

This started off as experiments for our early prototype called LazyWeb, and we're updating it to our real name, Andi. Andi is the name of the little bot.
